# TODO

Open work only. Completed items are **deleted**, never checked off — git history is the
archive; shipped milestones are recorded in `docs/milestones.md`. `docs/deferred.md` is the
pool of accepted-later work: **pull an item from it into Next when capacity or a decision
makes it near-term**, and delete it there when it lands. Anything stale in Parked graduates
to `ROADMAP.md` or dies. Hard line cap enforced by pre-commit: when it fires, prune.

## In motion

- **The citator is loaded** (v2026.09.19, rank v4): 25,777 rows, 22,547 edges, none shown; exposed
  428. **The review page, for a person**: docket, sub-docket and document in one look, linked to
  scan, text, both dockets and the match; same-docket filings citable (his); an ICC flag. GATED on
  the citations brief's 1-3; `panel_check_sheet.py`'s composition is its spec (untracked)
- **Three schema PRs (2026-09-15), critic passes done**: #35 `veto-trigger` (0030), then
  #37 `ocr-page-failure` (0031), then #36 `page-route` (0032). Merge in number
  order; each addendum is Proposed, his to accept; rehearse in production's image before release
- **HunyuanOCR tabular pass, PR #34** (26,245 pages unread, 1,394 decision-carried); the GPU
  parity probe waits on his fleet rule (`settings.local.json`); loading waits for his go
- **Claude batch for the 134 pages dots refused**: tool `claude_refused.py` on main, renders in
  the session scratchpad; submit waits on his `~/.anthropic-key`; loading waits for his go
- **Decided dates: measured** (`deferred.md` § 2026-09-15) — his call what to build

## Next

- **Party types, the held-out sheet is WITH THE OPERATOR** (2026-09-10,
  `docs/research/party-types/held-out/`). When his Copy block returns: apply both picks, score
  `party_types_rules.py --sheet` at 95% per type on the FIRST pick, then the assertion
  migration (schema-critic first) and the browse on `/parties`
- With the operator: a sheet's JSON-LD block in Google's Rich Results test, from a browser
- ADR 0024 Owed 2, the per-page failure record — HIS CHOICE to build (2026-09-15): addendum
  draft for the shape, schema-critic, his acceptance, then a branch
- **Held by the operator for rewording (2026-09-11)**: `/methodology`'s text-stage section
  (`848e366`) and the one-day-rest sentence (`3b538bc`); § Documents has his narrowed one
- The workstation gate's ONLOGON task is still unregistered (`deferred.md`)
- Seed wave 2 (after wave 3 tables): unresolved spans; pre-2020 roads and successions
- Deadline engine (C4): no obligations in decision JSON; fixture of 8 in `docs/deferred.md`

## Parked

- **Docket summaries (P6) and the AB status facet are specified, not chosen**
  (`docs/summaries.md`, 2026-09-10): the fifty-document sample is what a decision starts;
  the rule-only status slice (800 consummations, 714 trail-use filings) could go first
- A key held off the box (KMS), decrypting only at send time — ADR 0014's open forward step
- Stats deferrals: one month walker for `home.py`/`stats.py`; index `filing(filed_date)`
